# NIST MPTC Submission — Pulsar

This document is the cover sheet for the Pulsar submission to the
NIST Multi-Party Threshold Cryptography (MPTC) project. It is written
for NIST reviewers and points at every artifact a reviewer needs.

The `pulsar-mptc` repository is the **submission framework**: it
carries the cover sheet, the LaTeX spec, the high-assurance proof
artifacts (EasyCrypt, Lean bridge, Jasmin), the KAT vector format,
the constant-time evidence, and the tarball-cut tooling. The
algorithm being submitted is implemented in the canonical Pulsar
library at <https://github.com/luxfi/pulsar>; this framework pins
that library at `v1.0.6` (commit `20f87d8`) via `go.mod` and snapshots
it into `vendor/github.com/luxfi/pulsar/` at tarball-cut time via
`go mod vendor`, so a NIST reviewer gets a self-contained checkout
that does not require network access.

The repository is **active** (not frozen). The submission tarball is
cut from a tag on `main` at NIST's deadline via
`scripts/cut-submission.sh`; reviewer feedback and post-submission
patches land in this same repository so the artifact chain stays
auditable.

**Date stamp (this revision): 2026-05-18.**

**Maturity stamp**: v0.1 ready. This submission is **not**
NIST-ratified, **not** FIPS 140-3 validated, **not** ACVP-validated.
It is the algorithm-level reference plus reproducibility tooling
plus high-assurance proof artifacts. ACVP/CAVP/FIPS 140-3 are
downstream of this submission (see §"Layer 4" below).

## Headline claim

> Every signature produced by a Pulsar threshold ceremony
> (DKG → Round-1 → Round-2 → Combine) is **bit-identical** to a signature
> produced by single-party FIPS 204 ML-DSA-65 on the same message and
> group public key.

This is the **Class N1** claim. A FIPS-validated ML-DSA verifier
(BoringSSL FIPS, AWS-LC, OpenSSL 3.0 PQ provider) accepts a Pulsar
signature without modification.

**Theorem framing — accepted-path correctness.** The Class N1
byte-equality theorem is conditional on acceptance: *if* the threshold
combine (and the single-party comparator) accepts — i.e., passes the
ML-DSA norm and rejection checks and the kappa rejection-sampling loop
converged — *then* the produced byte string equals the centralized
ML-DSA-65 signature on the same protocol-level inputs, under the
stated layout, algebraic, and byte-walk assumptions. Acceptance
probability is tracked separately through the `accept_signing_attempt`
predicate and the `mldsa_accept_lower_bound` operational bound; ML-DSA
rejection sampling remains probabilistic per FIPS 204, and the
deterministic EC model captures the accepted-path conditioning via
the predicate rather than via probabilistic Hoare logic.

Cross-validation evidence: every KAT vector in `vectors/` is verified
by three independent ML-DSA implementations
(`test/interoperability/`):

1. The canonical Pulsar reference implementation at
   `github.com/luxfi/pulsar` v1.0.6 (commit `20f87d8`), pinned via
   `go.mod` and snapshotted into `vendor/` at tarball-cut time
2. The FIPS 204 reference (pq-crystals Dilithium C reference)
3. A third independent implementation (`cloudflare/circl` FIPS 204
   verifier; BoringSSL FIPS or OpenSSL 3.0 PQ provider when available)

## Algorithm scope and audit-response closure

The algorithm being submitted is the merged Pulsar implementation
at `luxfi/pulsar` v1.0.6 (commit `20f87d8`). The merge consolidated
the prior submission-grade implementation back into the production
canonical library so a single Go module is both production and
submission.

The following audit-response items are **closed on the
small-committee path (≤256 parties)**:

| ID | Issue | Resolution in v1.0.6 |
|---|---|---|
| CR-6 | DKG round-1 commit was vacuous | Removed. Each party's coefficient commitment is now bound to the long-term identity public key and to the DKG session identifier. |
| CR-7 | Threshold-sign session keys were absent | Each (sender, receiver, session-id, transcript) quadruple derives a fresh 32-byte session key from the authenticated ML-KEM-768 + HKDF stage; per-pair `SymmetricSession`. |
| CR-8 | DKG and reshare envelopes shipped in plaintext | Envelopes are now KEM-wrapped (ML-KEM-768) and authenticated under the long-term ML-DSA-65 identity key. Identity layer at `pulsar.GenerateIdentity` / `IdentityKey` / `IdentityDirectory` is mandatory. |

**Wide-committee (large_*) path scope**: the large-committee
GF(q)-arithmetic code path is present in v1.0.6 for production use,
but it currently runs the v0.1 plaintext-envelope flow and is **not
in the submission tarball's claim surface**. The KEM-wrapped
envelope flow for wide committees is the next deliverable on the
roadmap; the submission's N1 / N4 claims and KAT vectors are
small-committee-only (n ≤ 10, t ≤ 7 in the threshold-sign KAT
sweep; n ≤ 7 in the DKG sweep).

**Proof artifact counts (post-merge, v1.0.6 algorithm)**:

| Artifact | Count | Location |
|---|---|---|
| EasyCrypt files compiling clean, 0/0 admits | 13/13 | `proofs/easycrypt/` (gate: `scripts/checks/ec-compile.sh` + `scripts/checks/ec-admits.sh`) |
| Lean ↔ EC bridge files (algebraic identities) | 5/5 | `~/work/lux/proofs/lean/Crypto/` + `proofs/lean-easycrypt-bridge.md` (gate: `scripts/check-lean-bridge.sh`) |
| jasmin-ct blocking targets on the threshold layer | 3/3 | `jasmin/threshold/{round1,round2,combine}.jazz` (gate: `scripts/checks/jasmin.sh`) |

These artifact counts continue to refer to the merged v1.0.6
implementation; the proof artifacts themselves live in
`pulsar-mptc/{proofs/easycrypt, jasmin}/` and are unaffected by
the merge.

## What to read first

A reviewer with limited time should read in this order:

1. **`SUBMISSION.md`** (this file) — submission metadata and headline
2. **`NIST-SUBMISSION.md`** — one-page executive summary
3. **`spec/pulsar.pdf`** — full algorithm specification
   - §1 Introduction + §2 System model
   - §3 Parameters (ML-DSA-44 / 65 / 87)
   - §4 Protocol (DKG, Round-1, Round-2, Combine, Reshare)
   - §5 Security games (EUF-CMA threshold, identifiable abort)
   - §6 Output-interchangeability proof (the Class N1 claim)
   - §7 NIST MPTC category mapping
4. **`PROOF-CLAIMS.md`** — what's proved vs what's not (narrow claim)
5. **`AXIOM-INVENTORY.md`** — residual EC trust base, per-axiom closure plan
6. **`TRUSTED-COMPUTING-BASE.md`** — EC/Jasmin/OCaml TCB
7. **`FIPS-TRACEABILITY.md`** — op/lemma → FIPS 204 § map
8. **`docs/evaluation.md`** — performance + correctness + CT + sec-param evidence
9. **`PATENTS.md`** — royalty-free patent grant text
10. **`README.md`** — repository layout and how to reproduce
11. **`vectors/README.md`** — KAT format + cross-validation gates
12. **`BLOCKERS.md`** — what the construction does NOT
    claim (e.g. v0.1 cross-committee reshare without external state
    binding, identifiable-abort attribution under network partitions)

## What to run

The reproducibility gate is `scripts/build.sh` against the tarball
extract (which carries a pinned `vendor/github.com/luxfi/pulsar/`
tree, so no network access is required):

```bash
tar xzf submission-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz
cd pulsar-mptc
scripts/build.sh          # builds Go ref against vendored pulsar + spec PDF
scripts/test.sh           # runs unit + KAT + interoperability tests
scripts/bench.sh          # produces signature/verification benchmarks
scripts/gen_vectors.sh    # regenerates KAT vectors (deterministic)
```

`scripts/build.sh` exits non-zero on any failure. CI runs the same
script on every commit; the reproducibility property is the load-
bearing one for the submission.

To cut a fresh tarball from the framework repo (maintainer-side):

```bash
scripts/cut-submission.sh                       # dry-run, no tarball
scripts/cut-submission.sh submission-2026-11-16 # production cut + tag
```

The cut script verifies a clean tree, verifies all proof gates are
green, strips the local-dev `replace` directive from `go.mod`, runs
`go mod vendor` to snapshot `luxfi/pulsar` v1.0.6 into
`vendor/github.com/luxfi/pulsar/`, regenerates the KATs against the
vendored copy, re-runs the round-trip replay tests, tars, and prints
the SHA-256.

## Class N1 — Output interchangeability

The N1 claim is asserted at four levels of evidence:

| Evidence | Where |
|---|---|
| Algorithmic argument | `spec/pulsar.tex` §6, Theorem 6.1 |
| Symbolic / Lean proof | `proofs/lean/Crypto/Pulsar/OutputInterchange.lean` (out-of-repo, separate audit artifact) |
| Test harness | `test/interoperability/` runs every KAT through 3 independent verifiers |
| Cross-implementation KATs | `vectors/sign.json` shares vectors with FIPS 204 reference |

## Class N4 — Public-key preservation across resharing

Multi-party proactive resharing preserves the group public key across
committee rotations (epoch boundaries), so a single long-lived public
identity persists while the secret-share custodians rotate.

| Evidence | Where |
|---|---|
| Algorithmic argument | `spec/pulsar.tex` §4.5 (Reshare protocol) |
| Symbolic / Lean proof | `proofs/lean/Crypto/Pulsar/Shamir.lean` (Shamir + ring extension) |
| Test harness | `vectors/transcripts/n*-t*-reshare.jsonl` carry pre/post-reshare public keys + verify both verify under unmodified ML-DSA |

## High-assurance track (Jasmin + EasyCrypt)

Pulsar ships with a Jasmin + EasyCrypt high-assurance track aimed at
the same formal-method footing libjade gives the single-party ML-DSA
implementation: Jasmin sources whose verified compiler produces
bit-identical assembly, and EasyCrypt theories that machine-check
both functional correctness and constant-time against the
Barthe-Grégoire-Laporte leakage model.

The EasyCrypt track is **not theory shells** — every lemma in the
13-file tree is closed (admit budget enforced 0/0; see
`scripts/checks/ec-admits.sh`). What remains in the dependency cone
of the extracted N1 byte-equality theorem is a small, localized
axiom set:

| Artifact | Status | Location |
|---|---|---|
| libjade ML-DSA-65 single-party baseline (Jasmin + EasyCrypt) | Verified upstream; pinned, fetched on demand | `jasmin/ml-dsa-65/fetch.sh` |
| Pulsar Round-1 commit (Jasmin) | Implemented (~400 lines) | `jasmin/threshold/round1.jazz` |
| Pulsar Round-2 response (Jasmin) | Implemented (~600 lines) | `jasmin/threshold/round2.jazz` |
| Pulsar Combine (Jasmin) | Implemented (~400 lines) | `jasmin/threshold/combine.jazz` |
| Jasmin → EC extraction sanity | Per-push gate | `scripts/checks/extraction.sh` |
| jasmin-ct threshold (round1, round2, combine) | **BLOCKING — green** | `scripts/checks/jasmin.sh` |
| jasmin-ct libjade sign | Allowed-failure under #2 (precise write-up: `ct/jasmin-ct-libjade.md`) | same |
| Class N1 byte-equality (concrete extracted corollary) | **Proven as a lemma** (`pulsar_n1_byte_equality_extracted`) — composes the per-side wrapper-bridge equivs | `proofs/easycrypt/Pulsar_N1_Extracted.ec` |
| Class N1 byte-equality (generic, parametric) | **Proven as a theorem** (`pulsar_n1_byte_equality`) inside `section ClassN1` | `proofs/easycrypt/Pulsar_N1.ec` |
| Class N4 public-key preservation | **Proven** (concrete `ReshareHonest` module + `reshare_preserves_secret_honest` lemma) | `proofs/easycrypt/Pulsar_N4.ec` |
| Wrapper bridges (combine + sign) | **Proven as lemmas** (both — neither is an axiom) | `Pulsar_N1_{Combine,Sign}_Wrapper.ec` |
| Body separation (combine + sign) | **Proven as lemmas** | `Pulsar_N1_{Combine,Sign}_Refinement.ec` |
| Memory frame laws | **Proven** (0 axioms) | `Pulsar_N1_Memory.ec` |
| Build wiring | Per-check orchestrator; per-check scripts independently runnable | `scripts/check-high-assurance.sh` |

**Remaining trust footprint of the extracted N1 corollary**:

The c_tilde stage has been *decomposed and structurally factored*:
the top-level c_tilde byte-walk axioms are now derived lemmas, with
remaining trust localized to mu-derivation and w1-derivation
sub-axioms. This increases the raw axiom count from 6 stage-level
obligations (v4) to 4 stage-level plus 4 sub-stage obligations (v5),
but each remaining axiom is smaller, independently attackable, and
aligned with a concrete FIPS 204 computation boundary. This is
axiom decomposition; it is **not** full mechanized closure of the
c_tilde path — the underlying obligations remain axiomatized via
mu and w1.

| Category | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Stage-level byte-walk axioms (post v12) | 0 | All stage-level z + h + w axioms decomposed |
| z-stage y/cs1 sub-axioms (v11) | 2 | sign side: `sign_body_y_spec` + `sign_body_cs1_spec` (combine handled via v8 Lean bridge) |
| w-stage matrix_a/mask_y sub-axioms (v12) | 4 | combine + sign × {matrix_a, mask_y} |
| Accept-R-condition bridge (v13) | 1 | `accept_signing_attempt_iff_R1234` |
| Narrow combine-side extraction | 2 | `combine_body_z_via_aggregation_spec` (structural — extracted z is Lagrange aggregation of partial responses) + `combine_body_partial_responses_spec` (per-party partial responses match centralised) |
| c_tilde dependency sub-stage axioms | 2 | combine/sign × {w} only — w1 sub-stage further decomposed via HighBits in v7 |
| Derived c_tilde lemmas | 2 | `combine_body_c_tilde_spec`, `sign_body_c_tilde_spec` |
| Derived mu lemmas | 2 | `combine_body_mu_spec`, `sign_body_mu_spec` (v6) |
| Derived w1 lemmas | 2 | `combine_body_w1_spec`, `sign_body_w1_spec` (v7) |
| Derived combine z lemma | 1 | `combine_body_z_spec` (v8 — was primitive; now derived via Lean bridge) |
| Accepted-path no-reject axioms | 2 | unchanged |
| Lean-bridged algebraic axioms | 5 | +`threshold_partial_response_identity` (v8, Axiom 5 of bridge doc) |
| Codec roundtrip / layout axioms | existing + 3 | includes `pack_unpack_n1_signature_roundtrip` (v4) + `combine_body_mu_input_spec` and `sign_body_mu_input_spec` (v6, FIPS 204 §5.4.1 ExternalMu byte layouts) |

**v8 — combine z-stage Lean-bridged**: `combine_body_z_spec` is no
longer a primitive axiom; it is a derived lemma composing two
narrower combine-side facts (`combine_body_z_via_aggregation_spec`
on the aggregation shape, `combine_body_partial_responses_spec` on
per-party byte-walk) with the Lean Lagrange theorem
`Crypto.Threshold.Lagrange.threshold_partial_response_identity`
(`lean/Crypto/Threshold_Lagrange.lean:121`). The Lean theorem's
preconditions (uniq quorum, size match, polynomial degree bound,
honest sharing — collectively the **threshold interpolation
well-formedness** bundle) are now propagated as preconditions of
`pulsar_n1_byte_equality` and `pulsar_n1_byte_equality_extracted`.
The first two conjuncts (`uniq quorum`, `size shares = size quorum`)
were already present in the wrapper context; v8 threads the
remaining two (degree bound, honest evaluation) through to the
top-level equivalence statements so the bridge backstops the
derivation.

This is not full mechanized closure of the z stage. Trust has
moved from one stage-level byte-walk axiom (combine z) to one
narrower partial-response extraction axiom (a byte-walk) plus a
proven Lean theorem (the algebra). The next narrow target on this
side is `combine_body_partial_responses_spec` itself — a byte-walk
proving that the round-2 messages decode to per-party
`per_party_partial_response` values.

Detail on the byte-walk + sub-stage axioms:

- **4 stage-level byte-walk axioms**:
    combine side (tracked #4):
      `combine_body_z_spec`       — Lagrange-aggregated z + decompose
                                    (roadmap S3 + S5)
      `combine_body_h_spec`       — MakeHint stage (roadmap S7)
    sign side (tracked #3):
      `sign_body_z_spec`, `sign_body_h_spec`
- **2 c_tilde dependency sub-stage axioms** (NARROW; w only — mu sub-stage
  decomposed in v6, w1 sub-stage further decomposed in v7 via
  HighBits structural split):
    combine side: `combine_body_w_spec`
    sign side:    `sign_body_w_spec`
  Each is strictly narrower than the prior `w1_spec`: the w-stage
  axiom is about the polynomial-vector w BEFORE HighBits/decompose.
  The HighBits step is encoded as a STRUCTURAL DEFINITION on both
  sides (`Pulsar_N1.high_bits_of_w`, same op), not an axiom.
  `*_body_w1_spec` is a derived lemma on each side; combined with
  the v6 mu-stage decomposition and v5 SHAKE composition,
  `*_body_c_tilde_spec` is also derived.

- **2 FIPS 204 §5.4.1 ExternalMu byte-layout axioms** (NARROW,
  v6 — slot into the codec layout category):
    combine side: `combine_body_mu_input_spec`
    sign side:    `sign_body_mu_input_spec`
  Each says the extracted SHAKE-input byte buffer for the
  ExternalMu derivation matches the FIPS 204 §5.4.1 byte layout
  for (m, ctx). SHAKE semantics not in scope — pure byte layout.
  `*_body_mu_spec` is a derived lemma on each side, composed via
  the SHAKE structural identity (`shake256_to_mu`).

  Per-axiom attack surface (v7):
    `*_mu_input_spec` ↦ FIPS 204 §5.4.1 byte layout (codec, narrowest).
    `*_w_spec`        ↦ Polynomial vector w = A·y at the accepting
                        kappa. Reduces to `MLDSA65_Functional.mat_vec_mul`
                        + `expand_a` + `expand_mask` + an accepted-kappa
                        selection (loop or fixed-point model).
                        For combine, also reduces via the Lean Lagrange
                        bridge for threshold aggregation.
    `*_z_spec`        ↦ Lagrange aggregation (combine) / pure §6.2 z
                        (sign). Combine-side bridge:
                        `Crypto.Threshold.Lagrange.threshold_partial_response_identity`.
    `*_h_spec`        ↦ MakeHint over aggregated w_low / w_high.
                        Bridge target: `MLDSA65_Functional.vec_k_make_hint`.

  The composite `*_compute_components_spec`, `*_compute_sig_spec`,
  `*_body_c_tilde_spec`, `*_body_mu_spec`, and `*_body_w1_spec`
  are derived lemmas, not axioms.
- **2 accepted-path no-reject axioms** — protocol-correctness
  companions to the byte-walks
  (`combine_no_reject_on_accepted_honest_layout`,
  `sign_no_reject_on_accepted_honest_layout`). Each asserts
  `status = 0` for layout-conforming inputs CONDITIONED on the
  ML-DSA-65 accept event (`accept_signing_attempt`). ML-DSA
  rejection sampling remains probabilistic; the probability bound
  `mldsa_accept_lower_bound` (≈ 1 − 2^-128 after the kappa-bounded
  loop) is tracked operationally rather than via probabilistic
  Hoare logic — the deterministic EC model captures the accept-path
  conditioning via the predicate.
- **1 Lean-bridged algebraic axiom in the N1 cone**
  (`lagrange_inverse_eval` in `Pulsar_N1.ec`) — the
  Lagrange-interpolation identity at X = 0 over share_t. Bridged
  to `Crypto.Pulsar.Shamir.shamir_correct_at_target`.
- **3 additional Lean-bridged algebraic axioms in the N4 cone**
  (`add_share_zeroR`, `reconstruct_linear`, `shamir_correct` in
  `Pulsar_N4.ec`) — additive structure on share_t for reshare-
  preservation. Bridged to Mathlib `AddCommMonoid` +
  `Crypto.Threshold.Lagrange`.
- **Per-type FIPS 204 codec round-trip axioms** (~21 across
  `Pulsar_N1_Sign_Layout`, `Pulsar_N1_Combine_Layout`,
  `Pulsar_N1_Signature_Codec`, and `Pulsar_N1`) — encode/decode
  bidirectional round-trips guarded by `wf_*` well-formedness
  predicates, per-component length identities (sk: rho/K/tr/s1/s2/t0
  per FIPS 204 §3.5.4), share-polynomial-vector view (HIGH-5).
  Each reduces to the corresponding `MLDSA65_Functional` bit-level
  pack/unpack identity when that mechanization lands; for now they
  are small structural axioms over the abstract types.
- **0 section-local module-contract axioms** in the extracted
  corollary's cone (the corollary uses the concrete wrapper modules
  + proved bridge lemmas, not the section's declare-axiom
  hypotheses).

What this gives the NIST reviewer at submission time:

1. The libjade single-party verified baseline as the kernel under
   Pulsar's threshold layer — real, machine-checked, citable.
2. Real Jasmin sources for all three threshold-layer routines that
   call into the pinned libjade kernel.
3. The Class N1 byte-equality theorem **proven** in EasyCrypt as
   `pulsar_n1_byte_equality_extracted`, instantiating the generic
   `pulsar_n1_byte_equality` with concrete wrapper modules. Trust
   reduces to:
   - 4 stage-level byte-walks (z + h on combine and sign);
   - 2 c_tilde dependency sub-stage axioms (w on combine and sign — w1 step
     decomposed further via HighBits in v7);
   - 2 FIPS 204 §5.4.1 ExternalMu byte-layout axioms (mu_input
     on combine and sign, classified under codec layouts);
   - 2 accepted-path no-reject axioms (combine + sign);
   - 1 Lean-bridged algebraic identity in the N1 cone
     (`lagrange_inverse_eval`);
   - per-type FIPS 204 codec round-trips with `wf_*`
     well-formedness guards.

   `*_body_c_tilde_spec` (v5), `*_body_mu_spec` (v6), and
   `*_body_w1_spec` (v7) are DERIVED LEMMAS. The c_tilde, mu, and
   w1 decompositions together leave trust localized to:
     - The w sub-stage axiom (polynomial vector A·y at accepted
       kappa, FIPS 204 §6.2 — before HighBits)
     - The mu byte-layout axiom (FIPS 204 §5.4.1 ExternalMu, codec)
     - The z and h stage axioms (still bundled)
   This remains axiom decomposition, not full mechanized closure —
   trust is now localized to narrower obligations, but the obligations
   remain axiomatic.

   The N4 cone adds 3 more Lean-bridged algebraic axioms
   (`add_share_zeroR`, `reconstruct_linear`, `shamir_correct`).
4. The Class N4 reshare-preservation theorem **proven** as a
   concrete lemma on `ReshareHonest`.
5. jasmin-ct **blocking** on the threshold layer (round1, round2,
   combine all CT-clean); libjade sign advisory with a documented
   fix path.

What remains in the high-assurance track:

- The per-stage byte-walk obligations remaining after the v5
  c_tilde-stage, v6 mu sub-stage, and v7 w1 sub-stage decompositions:
    Stage-level (4): `combine_body_{z,h}_spec`, `sign_body_{z,h}_spec`
    w sub-stage (2): `combine_body_w_spec`, `sign_body_w_spec`
    mu byte-layout (2, codec category):
      `combine_body_mu_input_spec`, `sign_body_mu_input_spec`
  Each is independently attackable. The z-stage axioms have a
  Lean-bridge path through
  `Crypto.Threshold.Lagrange.threshold_partial_response_identity`;
  the mu byte-layout axioms reduce to FIPS 204 §5.4.1 byte
  serialization once `MLDSA65_Functional` exposes the bit-level
  ops; the w axioms reduce to `mat_vec_mul` + `expand_a` +
  `expand_mask` + an accepted-kappa loop model; the h axioms
  reduce to `vec_k_make_hint`. Roadmaps with named sub-claims
  are committed under `proofs/easycrypt/extraction/`.
- The two accepted-path no-reject obligations
  (`combine_no_reject_on_accepted_honest_layout`,
  `sign_no_reject_on_accepted_honest_layout`) — these reduce to the
  byte-walk completing the ML-DSA norm / rejection checks and the
  kappa rejection-sampling loop converging on the honest inputs,
  but are stated separately so the obligation surface is visible.
  The accompanying `mldsa_accept_lower_bound` probability tracking
  is an operational (non-mechanized) FIPS 204 acceptance bound.
- Mechanizing the Lean-bridged algebraic axioms inside EasyCrypt
  directly (1 in N1 cone, 3 in N4 cone) — would require porting a
  minimal polynomial-interpolation theory into EC.
- Concretizing the per-type FIPS 204 codec round-trips by linking
  them to `MLDSA65_Functional.pack_signature` /
  `MLDSA65_Functional.encode_sk` once the bit-level mechanization
  lands. The `wf_*` well-formedness predicates make the discharge
  point explicit.
- Closing the libjade jasmin-ct annotation gap (#2) upstream.

`scripts/check-high-assurance.sh` runs every per-push EC + jasmin-ct
+ extraction-sanity + bridge-guard + admit-budget + regression-guard
check at REAL budget. `scripts/nightly.sh` runs the heavier 1-h
fuzz + 10⁹-sample dudect runs that aren't appropriate for per-push.

## Path to 100% mechanized threshold-crypto correctness

This submission does **not** yet claim 100% mechanized threshold-
crypto correctness. The Class N1 byte-equality theorem is proven in
EasyCrypt as a lemma; closing the gap to fully mechanized correctness
requires closing the following named obligations.

### Remaining EC axioms in the corollary cone (8 + 1 + 4 + ~21)

1. **6 per-stage byte-walk axioms** on the extracted Jasmin /
   libjade procedures (4 stage-level z/h + 2 w sub-stage):
     - `combine_body_{w,z,h}_spec` — combine side (tracked #4)
     - `sign_body_{w,z,h}_spec`    — sign side    (tracked #3)
   Each maps to a concrete FIPS 204 sub-stage; closure paths are
   listed in the per-side accounting blocks. The w sub-stage is
   the narrowest remaining byte-walk after the v7 HighBits
   decomposition; it reduces to `mat_vec_mul` + `expand_a` +
   `expand_mask` + accepted-kappa selection. The z stage has a
   Lean Lagrange-aggregation bridge path.

   Plus **2 mu byte-layout axioms** (`combine_body_mu_input_spec`,
   `sign_body_mu_input_spec`) classified under FIPS 204 codec
   layouts (item 4 below) — they assert the extracted SHAKE-input
   buffer matches the FIPS 204 §5.4.1 ExternalMu layout for (m, ctx).

2. **2 accepted-path no-reject axioms**
   (`combine_no_reject_on_accepted_honest_layout`,
   `sign_no_reject_on_accepted_honest_layout`). Closing these
   requires modeling the kappa rejection loop's termination as a
   deterministic event under `accept_signing_attempt`. The
   probability tracking (`mldsa_accept_lower_bound`) is operational
   and would need a probabilistic Hoare-logic chain to formalize.

3. **4 Lean-bridged algebraic axioms** (`lagrange_inverse_eval` in
   N1 cone; `add_share_zeroR`, `reconstruct_linear`, `shamir_correct`
   in N4 cone). These are mechanized on the Lean side
   (`~/work/lux/proofs/lean/Crypto/`) and connected by a bridge
   document (`proofs/lean-easycrypt-bridge.md`). The current bridge
   is a hand-verified textual citation guarded by a CI check
   (`scripts/check-lean-bridge.sh`). **Replacing the bridges with
   checked translation artifacts** is the right step toward 100%
   mechanized — a translation layer that ingests both the Lean
   theorem statement and the EC axiom statement and machine-verifies
   their semantic equivalence. This is its own multi-week project;
   see `proofs/lean-easycrypt-bridge.md` for the obligation list.

4. **~21 FIPS 204 codec roundtrip axioms** (per-type encode/decode
   identities, `wf_*` well-formedness predicates). Closing these
   means concretizing the abstract types against
   `MLDSA65_Functional` bit-level pack/unpack ops. The `wf_*`
   predicates make the discharge point explicit, but the bit-level
   mechanization itself is a 6-month research project comparable
   to Barbosa-Barthe-Dupressoir's Dilithium mechanization (CRYPTO
   2023).

### Per-axiom closure paths

| Axiom | Closure path |
|---|---|
| `combine_body_mu_spec` | Byte-walk SHAKE-input region of combine.ec; equivalence to ExternalMu derivation. Narrowest remaining; smallest single sub-claim. |
| `combine_body_w1_spec` | Bridge through `decompose_vec_k` + `mat_vec_mul` on the Lagrange-aggregated A·y. |
| `combine_body_z_spec` | Lean bridge to `Crypto.Threshold.Lagrange.threshold_partial_response_identity`. Hardest combine-side closure (depends on Lean Lagrange theory). |
| `combine_body_h_spec` | Bridge through `vec_k_make_hint`. |
| `sign_body_{mu,w1,z,h}_spec` | Same as combine, minus the aggregation step (single-party flow). |
| `combine_no_reject_on_*_layout` | Probabilistic Hoare logic on the kappa rejection loop, conditioned on `accept_signing_attempt`. |
| `lagrange_inverse_eval`, `add_share_zeroR`, `reconstruct_linear`, `shamir_correct` | Either port the Lean polynomial-Lagrange theory to EC (multi-week), or replace the hand-bridged citation with a machine-checked translation artifact. |
| ~21 FIPS 204 codec roundtrips | Concretize abstract types against `MLDSA65_Functional` bit-level ops; requires the Barbosa-Barthe-Dupressoir style mechanization. |

### What 100% mechanized would buy

A claim that the Pulsar N1 byte-equality reduces purely to the
verified libjade Jasmin compilation pipeline plus the FIPS 204
standard text — no hand-bridged identities, no probabilistic
operational bounds, no abstract op surfaces. The trust footprint
would compose to: "if you trust the published FIPS 204 standard
and the Jasmin verified compiler, you trust every Pulsar signature".

This is the right north star for the post-submission audit cycle.
Each axiom converted to a derived lemma (or each primitive axiom
decomposed into strictly-narrower sub-axioms) is one step toward
it; v5/v6/v7 axiom decompositions are such steps (`*_body_c_tilde_spec`,
`*_body_mu_spec`, `*_body_w1_spec` are now derived lemmas; trust
localizes to narrower `*_body_w_spec`, `*_body_mu_input_spec`,
`*_body_{z,h}_spec` axioms).

## PQ security validation — evidence layers

A compiling EasyCrypt proof is **one layer** of PQ security
validation, not the whole story. NIST FIPS 204 standardizes ML-DSA
for digital signatures and states that it is believed secure even
against adversaries with a large-scale quantum computer
(<https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204>). A submission claim of
"post-quantum secure threshold ML-DSA" needs evidence across six
layers:

### Layer 1 — Algorithm-level PQ strength (assumed, not proved here)

| Item | This submission |
|---|---|
| Algorithm | ML-DSA (FIPS 204) — not pre-standard Dilithium |
| Parameter set | **ML-DSA-65** (NIST security category 3) |
| Claimed strength | Inherits the NIST ML-DSA-65 hardness analysis (Module-LWE / Module-SIS) |
| Hash/XOF usage | SHAKE128 / SHAKE256 per FIPS 204 |
| Encoding | pk / sk / sig / μ / w1 / z / h match FIPS 204 §3.5–§5.4 |
| Rejection sampling | Distribution and acceptance behavior per FIPS 204 §6.2 |
| Domain separation | Context string + pre-hash mode + message binding per FIPS 204 §5.4.1 ExternalMu |

The claim is: **this implementation targets FIPS 204 ML-DSA-65
semantics, assuming the ML-DSA-65 hardness assumptions and NIST
security-category analysis.** It is **not** a lattice-hardness
proof — the EasyCrypt refinement chain is an *implementation
correctness* result.

### Layer 2 — Implementation correctness (this is where the EC proof lives)

Refinement chain:

```
machine code / Jasmin / extracted implementation
  refines
low-level EasyCrypt model (Pulsar_N1_{Combine,Sign}_Refinement.ec)
  refines
centralized ML-DSA functional model (MLDSA65_Functional.ec)
  conforms to
FIPS 204 ML-DSA algorithm
```

Evidence delivered:

| Area | Evidence |
|---|---|
| EasyCrypt compile | `scripts/checks/ec-compile.sh` — 13/13 files, 0/0 admits |
| Axiom inventory | This document (residual trust base, below) |
| Derived lemmas | `*_body_c_tilde_spec`, `*_body_mu_spec`, `*_body_w1_spec`, `*_body_compute_{components,sig}_spec`, `*_body_{spec,separation}` — all no longer primitive |
| FIPS traceability | Per-axiom mapping below; per-op MLDSA65_Functional bridges |
| Extraction/model gap | Abstract ops `central_w`, `high_bits_of_w`, `shake_mu_w1`, `shake256_to_mu`, `external_mu_layout`, `pack_n1_signature` named with FIPS §-refs |
| Test vectors | `vectors/` directory (KAT format) — TODO: ACVP/CAVP cross-check |
| Differential testing | `test/interoperability/` — 3 independent ML-DSA verifiers |
| Negative tests | `test/negative/` — malformed inputs, boundary cases |

**Primitive EasyCrypt trust base after v7:**

| Axiom | Category | FIPS section | Residual risk | Closure plan |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `combine_body_w_spec` | byte-walk / polynomial | §6.2 | A·y at accepted κ + threshold aggregation | split into ExpandA, ExpandMask, mat_vec_mul + Lean Lagrange bridge for combine |
| `sign_body_w_spec` | byte-walk / polynomial | §6.2 | A·y at accepted κ | split into ExpandA, ExpandMask, mat_vec_mul |
| `combine_body_z_spec` | **DERIVED LEMMA (v8)** | §6.2 | n/a | replaced by `combine_body_partial_responses_spec` + `threshold_partial_response_identity` Lean bridge |
| `combine_body_z_via_aggregation_spec` | byte-walk / aggregation shape (v8) | §6.2 | extracted z's Lagrange shape | mechanical structural identity |
| `combine_body_partial_responses_spec` | byte-walk / per-party PR (v8) | §6.2 | per-party z_i extraction | narrow byte-walk through round-2 message parsing |
| `threshold_partial_response_identity` | Lean-bridged algebraic (v8) | §6.2 (FROST) | Lagrange-interpolation response identity | discharged in `lean/Crypto/Threshold_Lagrange.lean:121` |
| `sign_body_z_spec` | byte-walk / response | §6.2 | y + c·s1 at accepted κ | reduce via vec ops + accepted-κ model |
| `combine_body_h_spec` | byte-walk / hints | §6.2 | MakeHint over aggregated w_low/w_high | bridge to `MLDSA65_Functional.vec_k_make_hint` |
| `sign_body_h_spec` | byte-walk / hints | §6.2 | same as combine sans aggregation | same bridge |
| `combine_body_mu_input_spec` | codec layout | §5.4.1 | ExternalMu byte serialization | byte-level layout proof (mechanical) |
| `sign_body_mu_input_spec` | codec layout | §5.4.1 | same | same |
| `combine_no_reject_on_accepted_honest_layout` | protocol acceptance | §6.2 | honest accepted path | probabilistic Hoare logic on κ loop |
| `sign_no_reject_on_accepted_honest_layout` | protocol acceptance | §6.2 | same | same |
| `pack_unpack_n1_signature_roundtrip` | codec roundtrip | §3.5.5 | sig packing | bridge to `MLDSA65_Functional.pack_signature` |
| `lagrange_inverse_eval` | Lean-bridged algebraic | §6.2 (FROST) | Lagrange identity at 0 | replace with checked translation artifact |
| `add_share_zeroR`, `reconstruct_linear`, `shamir_correct` | Lean-bridged algebraic | (N4 cone) | Shamir/Lagrange algebra | same |
| ~21 per-type FIPS 204 codec round-trips | codec roundtrip | §3 | encode/decode pairs | Barbosa-Barthe-Dupressoir style bit-level mechanization |
| EasyCrypt / Jasmin / OCaml compiler TCB | trusted base | — | tooling correctness | external (compiler verification project) |

**Proof claim** (narrow): *Under these axioms and trusted
components, the N1 combine/sign implementation produces the same
signature components as the centralized ML-DSA-65 functional
model.*

### Layer 3 — Side-channel and fault security (separate evidence)

PQ implementations are typically broken in the implementation, not
the math. Required evidence:

| Risk | Validation status |
|---|---|
| Timing leakage on secret ops | `scripts/checks/jasmin.sh` — **jasmin-ct blocking** on threshold layer (round1, round2, combine all CT-clean); libjade sign advisory under #2 |
| Memory access leakage | Same (Jasmin-CT analysis) |
| Rejection sampling leakage | Documented in `ct/dudect/README.md` — `pulsar.Sign` is intentionally non-CT per FIPS 204 §3.3 |
| Randomness misuse | `ct/dudect/` — dudect statistical tests at 10⁹ samples (nightly) |
| Fault attacks | TODO: separate fault-injection analysis |
| Key erasure | Landed in `luxfi/pulsar` v1.0.6 (`zeroize.go`); fuzz harness and N1 byte-equality test ride alongside it. |
| Encoding malleability | `test/negative/` covers some cases — full coverage TODO |

Sensitive regions per FIPS 204: ExpandMask, sampling of y, w = A·y,
HighBits/LowBits, rejection checks, hint generation, secret-key
unpacking, any branch depending on secret or rejection conditions.
The EC functional refinement does NOT by itself prove constant-time
behavior; the jasmin-ct analysis provides that for the threshold layer.

### Layer 4 — Federal/compliance validation (separate tracks)

| Track | Status |
|---|---|
| ACVP / CAVP algorithm validation | TODO — lab-run pre-validation against NIST ACVP ML-DSA test vectors (<https://pages.nist.gov/ACVP/draft-celi-acvp-ml-dsa.html>) |
| FIPS 140-3 module validation | Out of scope — applies to a packaged crypto module, not this reference implementation |

For federal procurement, *"we implement ML-DSA"* is weaker than
*"ACVP/CAVP-validated ML-DSA implementation plus FIPS 140-3
validated module"*. This submission delivers the algorithm-level
reference implementation; module packaging + lab validation are
downstream of this submission.

### Layer 5 — Test evidence (delivered, partial)

Currently delivered (`scripts/test.sh`):
- KAT vectors against pq-crystals reference (Dilithium3) via differential testing
- BoringSSL FIPS / OpenSSL 3.0 PQ provider cross-validation (when available)
- Internal KAT vectors in `vectors/` (deterministic generation)

Required for full validation:
- NIST ACVP-style KATs (ACVP ML-DSA test vector format)
- Randomized signing vectors with seed control
- Malformed pk/sk/sig tests
- Context-string boundary tests (0, 1, 255 bytes)
- Message-length boundary tests
- Cross-implementation differential tests
- Decoder/verifier fuzz testing

### Layer 6 — Standard conformance audit (external)

The EasyCrypt refinement chain says the implementation matches a
functional model that *conforms to* FIPS 204 — but the conformance
itself is by inspection, not machine-checked. A formal conformance
audit by an accredited lab (or NIST-recognized review) is the
external evidence step.

### What this submission delivers vs. what it doesn't

**Delivered**:
- Layer 2 (implementation correctness) at the strongest level
  short of full mechanized closure — EC refinement proof with
  enumerated residual axioms;
- Layer 3 (side-channel) on the threshold layer (Jasmin-CT blocking
  green; libjade sign advisory documented under #2);
- Layer 5 (test evidence) for differential and KAT validation.

**Not delivered (out of scope or future work)**:
- Layer 1 PQ hardness claim — assumed from NIST analysis;
- Layer 4 ACVP/CAVP/FIPS 140-3 validation — lab work downstream;
- Layer 6 standard conformance audit — external evidence;
- Full Layer 2 mechanized closure of all residual axioms
  (multi-month research project for the codec axioms; multi-week
  for each of the w/z/h byte-walks).

### Recommended next proof work (post-submission)

Per the user's review prioritization (revised after v7):

1. **`*_body_z_spec`** — likely easier than full w_spec with the
   Lean Lagrange bridge already stable. Use
   `Crypto.Threshold.Lagrange.threshold_partial_response_identity`
   for combine; reduce via vec ops + accepted-κ model for sign.
2. **`*_body_mu_input_spec`** — byte-layout proof, mechanical and
   high-confidence once the FIPS 204 §5.4.1 byte serialization
   is concretised.
3. **`*_body_h_spec`** — bridge toward `vec_k_make_hint`.
4. **`*_body_w_spec`** — the hardest target; requires the
   loop/fixed-point accepted-κ model + ExpandA/ExpandMask/mat-vec.

This reverses the earlier ordering (which had w as the natural
next target after w1's HighBits decomposition). The revised
ordering optimizes for fastest residual-trust reduction.

## What this submission does NOT claim

Read `BLOCKERS.md` for the authoritative list. Highlights:

- **No identifiable abort under network partition** — Pulsar
  identifies aborting parties under synchronous network assumptions;
  asynchronous identifiable abort requires the Z-Chain Groth16
  accountability layer (separate Lux artifact, not part of this
  submission).
- **No 1-round signing** — the construction is 2-round by design. The
  rejection-sampling step inherent to FIPS 204 ML-DSA precludes a
  1-round threshold variant without a non-NIST-standard preprocessing
  oracle.
- **DKG without external randomness beacon** — Pulsar DKG produces
  unbiased coefficients under honest-majority assumptions but does not
  provide bias resistance under collusion. Production deployments
  bind a randomness beacon at the consensus layer (out of scope here).
