# Pulsar-M — NIST MPTC submission package

> **Threshold ML-DSA** — a 2-round threshold signing and DKG system whose
> generated signatures are verifiable by **unmodified FIPS 204 ML-DSA
> verification**. Targeting NIST MPTC Class N1 (signing) + N4 (ML keygen / DKG).

This repository is the **frozen NIST MPTC submission package** for Pulsar-M.
The production Go library has moved on to a stable module identity; this
repository is the submission artifact pinned to the state NIST reviewers
will see.

## Library identities (post-2026 split)

`Pulsar-M` is the Module-LWE threshold ML-DSA construction. The 2-round
threshold protocol structure operates on ML-DSA-65's polynomial-vector-
over-`R_q` algebra so the per-party-aggregated signature is bit-identical
to a single-party FIPS 204 signature on the same message + public key.

| Repository | Module path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **luxfi/pulsar-mptc** (this repo) | `github.com/luxfi/pulsar-m` | Frozen NIST MPTC submission package |
| [luxfi/pulsar](https://github.com/luxfi/pulsar) | `github.com/luxfi/pulsar` | Production Module-LWE Go library |
| [luxfi/corona](https://github.com/luxfi/corona) | `github.com/luxfi/corona` | Production Ring-LWE Go library (sibling kernel) |

The module path inside this submission package remains
`github.com/luxfi/pulsar-m` because that is the identifier NIST receives
and reviews against the submitted KAT vectors and spec. Downstream
consumers who want the live production library should pin
`github.com/luxfi/pulsar@v1.0.x` (Module-LWE) or
`github.com/luxfi/corona@v0.2.x` (Ring-LWE) instead.

> **Status: Research / Reference (not production hardened, not FIPS validated).**
> NIST-profile vectors use SHAKE / cSHAKE / KMAC. Any BLAKE3 deltas are
> experimental and out-of-scope for the MPTC submission.

## Why

NIST FIPS 204 (ML-DSA) is the only NIST-approved post-quantum digital
signature in 2026. Threshold variants of ML-DSA are not yet standardized —
NIST's [Multi-Party Threshold Cryptography](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/threshold-cryptography)
project is collecting them now (IR 8214C, January 2026; first call package
deadline expected 2026-Nov-16).

Pulsar-M aims to enter that process with a credible, output-interchangeable
threshold ML-DSA candidate — built from the production-tested protocol
machinery already shipping in `luxfi/pulsar` (R-LWE), retargeted to the
M-LWE primitives ML-DSA itself uses.

The win, if Pulsar-M's Sign output is byte-equal to FIPS 204 Sign:
- Threshold-produced signatures verify under unmodified FIPS 204 verifiers.
- Existing FIPS-validated ML-DSA modules (BoringSSL FIPS, AWS-LC, OpenSSL
  3.0 PQ provider) consume Pulsar-M certs without code changes.
- The threshold layer can be Class-N-claimed at NIST without a parallel
  algorithm standardization track.

## Quickstart

> **Pulsar-M is in pre-spec stage.** Reference impl, vectors, and bench harness
> ship after the spec freezes. Track [docs/known-limitations.md](docs/known-limitations.md)
> for what's stable vs in-flight.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luxfi/pulsar-m
cd pulsar-m
./scripts/build.sh       # checks spec compile + Go build
./scripts/test.sh        # runs unit + KAT suite (when available)
./scripts/bench.sh       # reproduces bench/results/ (when available)
./scripts/gen_vectors.sh # regenerates KATs from reference impl (when available)
```
