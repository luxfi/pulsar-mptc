// types.go — public data types used across the Pulsar-M reference
// implementation. The wire layout of every wire-bound type freezes at
// the encoding-freeze gate (DD-008); until then, on-the-wire bytes are
// stable per-test-vector but not stable across patch releases.

// NodeID is the canonical party identifier used in all Pulsar-M
// protocols. The 32-byte width matches the Lux validator-ID format and
// is wide enough to host an arbitrary external identifier (for example
// a Hanzo IAM subject hash). Index 0 is forbidden because the Shamir
// evaluation point at x=0 holds the master secret; any party with
// nominal index 0 is rejected by params validation.
