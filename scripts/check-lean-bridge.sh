# Lean ↔ EasyCrypt Shamir bridge guard.
#
# Each of the four EC axioms named in proofs/lean-easycrypt-bridge.md
# must:
#   1. Still exist in the EC source as an `axiom` (not `lemma`).
#   2. Carry an inline citation comment naming the Lean theorem.
#   3. The Lean theorem named in the citation must EXIST in the
#      named Lean file (hardened guard — post-audit).
#
# Plus:
#   4. The bridge doc must exist.
#   5. Every EC file path mentioned in the bridge doc text must
#      exist on disk (catches stale refs to decomplected files).
#
# If any of these checks fails, this script exits 2 and the
# high-assurance gate fails. The Lean repo is expected to live at
# ~/work/lux/proofs (one of several supported standard locations);
# the script auto-detects it.
