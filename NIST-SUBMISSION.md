## Headline claim

> Every signature produced by a Pulsar threshold ceremony (DKG →
> Round-1 → Round-2 → Combine) is **bit-identical** to a signature
> produced by single-party FIPS 204 ML-DSA-65 on the same message
> and group public key.

**Theorem framing**: accepted-path correctness. *If* the threshold
combine accepts (passes ML-DSA norm + kappa rejection checks),
*then* the produced byte string equals the centralized ML-DSA-65
signature on the same protocol-level inputs, under the stated layout,
algebraic, and byte-walk assumptions enumerated in
`AXIOM-INVENTORY.md`. Acceptance probability is tracked separately
through `accept_signing_attempt` and `mldsa_accept_lower_bound`.

| Test vectors | `vectors/` (5 JSON sets + per-(n,t) transcripts) |
| Security analysis | `spec/pulsar.tex` §5 + `pulsar-m/*.tex` (separate audit artifact) |
| Patent / IP statement | `PATENTS.md` (royalty-free grant) + `docs/patent-claims.md` (attorney prep) |

## What makes this submission different

1. **Byte-identical output to FIPS 204** — any FIPS-validated ML-DSA
   verifier (BoringSSL FIPS, AWS-LC, OpenSSL 3.0 PQ provider)
   accepts a Pulsar signature without modification. No verifier-side
   changes needed.

2. **Machine-checked refinement proof** — EasyCrypt N1 byte-equality
   theorem `pulsar_n1_byte_equality_extracted` (`proofs/easycrypt/`),
   13 files compile clean with 0/0 admits, Lean ↔ EC bridges verified
   at every CI push (5/5).

3. **Jasmin high-assurance implementation** — Threshold layer
   constant-time-clean under jasmin-ct (blocking gate 3/3); libjade
   single-party sign advisory under tracked issue #2.

4. **N4 reshare with public-key preservation** — proactive secret-
   sharing across committee rotation, preserving the group public
   key (`Pulsar_N4.reshare_preserves_secret_honest` theorem).

5. **Identifiable abort with third-party-verifiable evidence** —
   TLV-encoded per-kind abort evidence; verifier-protocol-independent;
   fuzz-tested at 627K execs (commit `effc648`).

6. **Reproducibility-first** — `scripts/build.sh` is deterministic
   from a 48-byte seed; KAT vectors regenerate bit-identical from
   the same seed; CI enforces drift = build bug.

## Trust footprint (one-screen summary)

After v10 (latest commit on submission branch):

| Category | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Stage-level byte-walks | 1 | `sign_body_z_spec` only |
| c_tilde dep w sub-stage | 2 | `*_body_w_spec` |
| c_tilde dep w_low sub-stage (v10) | 2 | `*_body_w_low_spec` |
| Combine z extraction (v8) | 2 | `combine_body_{partial_responses,z_via_aggregation}_spec` |
| Codec mu_input layout (v9) | 4 | 3 combine per-range + 1 sign byte-layout |
| Accepted-path no-reject | 2 | `*_no_reject_on_accepted_honest_layout` |
| Lean-bridged algebraic (v8) | 5 | Including `threshold_partial_response_identity` |
| Codec roundtrip (pack_n1) | 1 | `pack_unpack_n1_signature_roundtrip` |
| Per-type FIPS 204 codec roundtrips | ~21 | enumerated in `AXIOM-INVENTORY.md` §7 |
| **Derived lemmas (no longer primitive)** | 11+ | `*_body_{c_tilde,mu,w1,mu_input,h}_spec` × 2 sides + `combine_body_z_spec` |
| EC admit budget | **0 / 0** | hard-pinned by `scripts/checks/ec-admits.sh` |

`PROOF-CLAIMS.md`. TCB: `TRUSTED-COMPUTING-BASE.md`. FIPS 204 §-map:
`FIPS-TRACEABILITY.md`.

## What this submission does NOT claim

| Out-of-scope claim | Why |
|---|---|
| Post-quantum hardness of ML-DSA | Assumed from NIST FIPS 204 analysis |
| ACVP/CAVP algorithm validation certificate | Downstream — lab work post-submission |
| FIPS 140-3 module validation | Downstream — applies to packaged modules |
| Threshold SLH-DSA (FIPS 205) | Tier 3 experimental; not in v0.1 |
| Asynchronous identifiable abort | Synchronous only; async requires Z-Chain Groth16 accountability (separate Lux artifact) |
| 1-round signing | FIPS 204 rejection-sampling precludes 1-round without non-standard preprocessing |
| DKG without external randomness beacon | Honest-majority unbiased; production deployments bind a randomness beacon at the consensus layer |

## Reproducibility commitment

```bash
git clone --branch submission-2026-11-16 https://github.com/luxfi/pulsar-mptc
cd pulsar-mptc
opam switch jasmin && opam install . --deps-only
scripts/build.sh                # builds reference impl + spec PDF
scripts/check-high-assurance.sh # proof + CT gate (expect green)
scripts/test.sh                 # KAT cross-validation (expect 3-way match)
scripts/bench.sh                # performance (expect within 5% of REPORT.md)
```

Drift between submission tarball and reproduced output is a build
bug — please file at the GitHub issues link above. NIST reviewers
should obtain byte-identical artifacts on reproduction.

## Patent / IP posture (TL;DR)

- **Code**: Apache-2.0.
- **Patents**: Royalty-free grant to any FIPS 204-conformant implementation
  released under Apache-2.0 or compatible OSI license, OR any
  NIST MPTC/PQC/ACVP submission/validation/interoperability test.
- **Defensive termination**: license terminates against any party
  asserting patents against Pulsar, FIPS 204 ML-DSA, or any other
  NIST-standardized PQ signature scheme.
- **Full text**: `PATENTS.md` §3.
